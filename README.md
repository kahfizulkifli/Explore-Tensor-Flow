Explore Tensor Flow for the first time

## 17 October 2020:
Tried the free Udacity Intro to Tensorflow course lesson 1 to lesson 3. We learnt about what is machine learning and how it is different to traditional programming. I also experimented with two types of machine learning techniques: regression and classification. 

Regression: Training a machine to automatically convert temperatures from celcius to fahrenheit. This is too much for this problem, a simple algorithm in Pyhton will do

Classification: Using database from MNIST, we classified grey pictures of clothing to their specified groups.
